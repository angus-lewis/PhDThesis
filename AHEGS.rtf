\f0\fs24 \cf0 Expressions for the performance measures of fluid-fluid queues have been derived, however, they are not readily computable. This thesis investigates approximations to facilitate their computation. Two main approximations are investigated; one based on the well-known discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, and a novel method based on a mathematical generalisation of the quasi-birth-and-death process. Numerical evidence suggests that the DG method is effective when the solution is smooth but can produce invalid (negative) solutions when there are discontinuities, whereas the novel method guarantees non-negative solutions but requires more computational work. The thesis also proves that the novel method is theoretically valid (converges).}
