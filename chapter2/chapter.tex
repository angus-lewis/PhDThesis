\chapter{Approximating fluid queues with the discontinuous Galerkin method \label{ch:galerkin}} 
% The DG method for B 
    % direct copy paste from the paper
% Problems with DG, non-neg/oscillations
    % solutions: filtering and limiting
% Approximating R: projection, interpolation, cell averages (eluding to QBD-RAP and unif method)
% Approximating Psi (and the stationary distribution, but this isnt really necessary)
    % constructing D
    % solving the matrix-Riccati equation, iteration/algorithm. 

% Appendix: the toy model. 
% Appendix: some properties of B?
