**Numerical methods for analysing fluid queues**

+ intro 
	- explain problem and put in context of literature (!)
	- why is it interesting and what is the contribution of the thesis
	- introduce running example, use throughout

+ mathematical preliminaries
	- Fluid queues
	- MEs 
		+ Contrast with PH
	- QBD/QBD-RAP
		+ Contrast the two
	? Galerkin, Finite Volume

? Galerkin methods for fluid queues
	- running example
	- motivate the chapters to follow

+ Analysis of a fluid queue as a QBD-RAP

+ Convergence analysis of ^ 

+ Numerical Experiments chapter
	- running example

+ Conclusion

+ Big appendix
	- add some signposting, a bit more narative
	- re-state theorems before proving them
